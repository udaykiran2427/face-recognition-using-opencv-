# Face Recognitio Project

This project implements a face recognition system using OpenCV and the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm. It allows you to detect and recognize faces from images.
## Features
- Face detection using Haar Cascades.
- Face recognition with a trained LBPH model.
- Ability to save and load the trained model for future use.

## Project Structure
- Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection.
- LBPH for face recognition.
- Scripts for training and recognizing faces.

## Requirements
- Mine current Python 3.11.2 version
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Also used opencv's haar cascade the training script to detect faces.
